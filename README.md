# Usage:
MazeSolver has two main pages: Camera and Gallery. You can use the camera to capture a new maze image, or the gallery to recall the solution to a maze you have already solved with MazeSolver.

| Camera View | Gallery View |

After capturing a maze image using the camera, you will be prompted with a screen that will allow you to view the image you have just captured, and decide if it is good enough* to solve. By tapping on the "Solve" button, the image will be sent to our servers, and a solution will be returned to you within seconds. If you decide that the image is not sufficient, you can tap the "Back" button to try capturing another image.
