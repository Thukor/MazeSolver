# MazeSolver


Simple Maze Solver App

There are currently 2 Android Studio projects:
* Camera2APITestApp - This application only has a camera and it is able to capture a single image and save it to phone storage.
* Tabbed Application - This application has a tabbed layout with a tab for camera and a tab for saved maze solutions. The camera preview works, but there is no method to capture or save images at this time.
